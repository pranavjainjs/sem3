# 3rd semester IITG CSE

This repo contains a few resources that many of my batchmates and I found useful in the odd semester - 2022, at IIT Guwahati.

If you are pursuing CSE from IIT Guwahati, these might help you as well.

CSEA would conduct a comprehensive academic talk and provide other materials (including previous year questions) as and when required.
